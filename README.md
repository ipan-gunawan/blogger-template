# Introduction
This is a template that I usually use for making custom blogger template. The content in this file is just for the requirements to make custom template in blogger, for the inner content of your blog you still have to make it by yourself! 

## Usage
To use this code, you just go to the [index.xhtml](./index.xhtml) file and copy the code then paste it in <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://www.blogger.com/" target="blank">Blogger</a> template editor.
